# Sample cases and background,
- Python KE event has two sites 1.https://www.pyconke.org/ 2.https://www.pycon.or.ke/, uses [sessionize] https://sessionize.com for the breakouts. No subchapters or anything e.g django, DS/ML, micropython, etc. 
- events ride a lot on twitter to share trivial event info like photos and stuff

# Tickets and RSVP
 I'm yet to experience being thrown out for not having a ticket/RSVP'd but a ticket is, in a tech event, to serve this purposes:
  i. serving snacks
  ii. giving out merch, mostly tee's *note: merch/swaag is not always free, some are paid*
